Overview of the Tic Tac Toe Game Project Using Python

The Tic Tac Toe game is a classic two-player game that can be implemented in Python, providing an excellent project for beginners to learn about object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and graphical user interface (GUI) development. This project can be approached using different libraries, such as Pygame or Tkinter, each offering unique features and capabilities.
Project Goals
Understand OOP Concepts: Utilize classes and objects to manage game state and player interactions.
Implement Game Logic: Create the rules for winning, drawing, and taking turns.
Develop a GUI: Use either Pygame or Tkinter to create an interactive interface.

Key Components of the Project
Game Board:
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Each cell can be marked with either 'X' or 'O'.
Player Interaction:
Players take turns clicking on the grid to place their marks.
The program checks for a win condition or a draw after each move.

Game Logic:
The game determines the winner by checking rows, columns, and diagonals for three consecutive marks.
If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
Implementation Steps
Using Pygame

Setup: Initialize Pygame and create a window for the game.
Drawing the Grid: Render the 3x3 grid on the screen.
Event Handling: Capture mouse clicks to determine where players place their marks.
Game Loop: Continuously check for events (like mouse clicks) and update the display accordingly.
